## Examining Evolution of Starch Metabolism in Primates
### *Audrey Tjahjadi*
--------------------

### Overview

This is the project site for my final project for Intro to Bioinformatics. This project will examine the evolutionary history of two starch-metabolizing enzymes, maltase-glucoamylase and sucrase-isomaltase, in the primate clade. The analysis will utilize techniques such as multiple sequence alignment and generation of phylogenetic trees and give additional practice for implementing these techniques.  

### Genes of Interest



### Primate Species

The analysis will include DNA sequences taken from Genbank for the 29 species of primate shown in the tree below. Highlighted in blue is the clade containing the great apes and humans.
