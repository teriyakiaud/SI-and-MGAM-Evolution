## Examining Evolution of Starch Metabolism in Primates
### *Audrey Tjahjadi*
--------------------

### Overview

This is the project site for my final project for Intro to Bioinformatics. This project will examine the evolutionary history of two starch-metabolizing enzymes, maltase-glucoamylase and sucrase-isomaltase, in the primate clade. The analysis will utilize techniques such as multiple sequence alignment and generation of phylogenetic trees. 

### Genes of Interest



### Primate Species

The analysis will include sequences from 29 species taken from Genbank.
